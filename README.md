# Dark Web Monitoring

A **Threat Intelligence** tool designed to **monitor the dark web** for leaked credentials, stolen data, and cyber threats. This project automates **scraping**, **keyword detection**, and **email alerts** to notify users of potential security risks.  

##  Features  
**Dark Web Scraping** – Extracts data from hidden marketplaces & forums  
 **Keyword-Based Alerts** – Detects sensitive terms like "leaked passwords" or "breached data"  
 **SQLite Database** – Stores findings for later analysis 
 **Modular & Scalable** – Easily customizable for different threat intelligence needs  

##  Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Requests, BeautifulSoup, SQLite)  
- **Web Scraping** (OSINT Techniques)  
- **Threat Intelligence Automation**
- **Tor** (For accessing .onion sites)
